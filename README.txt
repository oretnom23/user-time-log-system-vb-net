User Time-In System v.1 (UTIS)

Description: A system that acts like a biometrics does. With real-time logging, this system makes it possible to record the time-in and time-out of a user's attendance with ease. It provides a user-friendly UI and shortcut keys and for fast processing of records and logging. It also has a picture for each user to ensure user's identity when being logged. This app is good for school and office wherein they maintain a huge record for attendance. Hope you all like this system :)
